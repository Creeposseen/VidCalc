Visicalc is a simple program that allows you to calculate the duration of all videos in one folder (Not several)
Instruction manual:
1. Start 
2. Waiting for the UI (Sometimes it may take a few seconds, it will NOT be fixed)
3. Select the folder with the video and get the total duration (And the duration of each of the files in CMD)
